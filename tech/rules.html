        These are the server rules: <br />
        Rule 1: Hacking or exploiting glitches in the site in any way will result in immediate loss of countries. <br />
        Rule 2: Requested features go in <a  target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12m3LFtHSo4TECnCTpuhExLOxVx57wRwtNM020W3VM-k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> <br />
        Rule 3: Please be nice, and don't get annoyed over people taking you over etc, it's all good fun! :) <br />
        Rule 4: If links aren't working for some reason, try reloading the page, and if that still doesn't work, ask Kat/Sara/Cali to help. <br />
        Rule 5: Enjoy! Let Kat or Sara (or Cali even though I'm sort of incompetent) know if you need help! <br />
